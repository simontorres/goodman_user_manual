User and Developer Manuals
##########################

The user and developer manuals are created using Sphinx. The source files are
written in *reStructuredText* a markup language with simple syntaxis that allows
for rich formatting. You can start `here <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_
Although the language's syntaxis is simple you need to familiarize with it, or
you might get scared away, but don't worry, is really easy.

Preparation
***********

I recommend using `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_ I will not
provide instrucctions for installing it but is easy and you can find
instructions in their site. Also because the installation depends on the platform.

You will also need a `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ account and very important
`Register your public ssh key <https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/>`_
on GitHub.

And finally define a directory structure, here I present my suggestion but feel
free to ignore this in case you already have yours. Keep in mind here that the
most important here is to have *something that works* for you.

    ``mkdir -p ~/documentation/soar``

    ``cd ~/documentation/soar``

Get the source Files
********************

The source files are stored on GitHub.com, in order to obtain them simply do:

    ``git clone git@github.com:soar-telescope/goodman_user_manual.git``

All the repository will be downloaded to ``goodman_user_manual``

Open *PyCharm* and go to ``File > Open`` Navigate to
``~/documentation/soar/goodman_user_manual``
and click *Open*

Choose *Open in a new window* when asked.

Editing the Manuals
*******************

This `rst cheatsheet <https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst>`_
seems a very good resource to start. I will not go into further details here.

Building the PDF Files
**********************

In order to produce the pdfs, first you need to configure *PyCharm*. Go to
``Run > Edit Configurations...``

- Click the green plus sign and select ``Python Docs... > Sphinx task``.

- Edit the fields so they will look like this:

    - For the Developers Manual

        ``Name: create_pdf_dev_manual``

        ``Command: pdf``

        ``Input: ~/documentation/soar/goodman_user_manual/dev_manual/``

        ``Output: ~/documentation/soar/goodman_user_manual``

    - For the Users Manual:

        ``Name: create_pdf_user_manual``

        ``Command: pdf``

        ``Input: ~/documentation/soar/goodman_user_manual/user_manual/``

        ``Output: ~/documentation/soar/goodman_user_manual``

Commit to GitHub
****************

Once you have completed a feature click this button |commit| to do a commit to
your repository.


.. |commit| image:: img/vcs_up.png
    :align: middle
    :width: 40

This will open a pop up window. In the upper left region you see the modified
files, below this you type a *Commit Message*, this has to be precise, not
too short not too long, just a reminder of what you did. At the bottom you
can see the changes you are introducing in the file selected in the top
left section of the window.

If you select *Commit and Push* this will update the local repository as well as
the remote, i.e, the GitHub hosted version. If you choose *Commit*  only the
changes will not be uploaded. Later you can go to ``VCS > Git > Push..``.
