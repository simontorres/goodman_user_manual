Acknowledgements
################
We acknowledge the important contribution of  David Sammartin, who developed
the initial incarnation of the redccd module. We thank Tina Armond for her
invaluable help in adding calibrated comparison lamps to the library of
reference comparison lamps for wavelngth solution.

Our work would not be possible without the friendly work atmosphere at CTIO
headquarters in La Serena, were we can interact with our SOAR and CTIO
colleagues in lively and useful discussions that have been important in making
the Goodman pipeline possible.  We also acknowledge fruitful discussions and
suggestions from our colleagues Bart Dunlop, Chris Clemens, and Erik Dennihy,
at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
