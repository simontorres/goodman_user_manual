Features Available
******************

- Self-contained, full data reduction package for the most commonly used
  predefined setups with Goodman HTS.  Given the almost limitless number of
  possible configurations available with the Goodman instrument, only the most
  popular configurations will be supported, though we will try to add as many
  modes as possible.
- Python based, using existing Astropy libraries as much as feasible.
- Extensively documented, using general coding standards: PEP8 – Style Guide,
  PEP257 – Docstrings Convention (in-code documentation) – Google Style
- Multiplataform compatibility (tested on Linux Ubuntu, CentOS and MacOSX).
- Modular design. Could be used as a library within other Python applications.
