Running the Pipeline
####################
The |pipeline full name| is designed to be simple to use, however help is always
necessary.

Getting Help.
  This manual is intended to be the prefered method to get help. However the quickest option is using ``-h`` or ``--help``

  ``redccd --help``

  Will print the list of arguments along with a quick explanation and default values.

  It is the same for ``redspec``

  ``redspec --help``
